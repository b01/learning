# kubeadm Cluster Install

1. Add the Kubernetes GPG key to be trusted on your system:
   ```shell
   curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.33/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
   ```
   NOTE: This is pointing to the version 1.33 repository.
2. Add the appropriate Kubernetes apt repository:
   ```shell
   echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.33/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
   ```
3. Update the apt package index, install kubelet, kubeadm and kubectl, and pin their version:
   ```shell
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
   sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
   ```
4. You need to choose which IP CIDR ranges you want to use for IPv4 and also
   IPv6 if your going dual stack. The ones provided here are from examples in
   the Kubernetes documentation, which are private class for IPv4 and
   global unicast for IPv6:
   ```text
   IPv4 POD network:     10.244.0.0/16
   IPv4 Service Network: 10.96.0.0/16
   IPv6 POD network:     2001:db8:42:0::/56
   IPv6 Service Network: 2001:db8:42:1::/112
   ```
5. Begin installing the cluster on the control plane:
    1. Log into the control plane with `ssh vagrant@control-plane-01`.
    2. Generate a **ClusterConfiguration** object with default values by running
       `kubeadm config print init-defaults > kubeadm-config.yaml`.
    3. Modify the configuration to include the IPv4/IPv6 CIDRs, advertise
       address, and control-plane DNS endpoint of your choosing like so:
       ```yaml
       ---
       apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta4
       kind: InitConfiguration
       localAPIEndpoint:
         advertiseAddress: 2000:192:168:56::11
         bindPort: 6443
       nodeRegistration:
         kubeletExtraArgs:
           - name: node-ip
             value: 2000:192:168:56::11,192.168.56.11
       ---
       apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta4
       kind: ClusterConfiguration
       kubernetesVersion: 1.33.0
       networking:
         dnsDomain: cluster.local
         podSubnet: 2001:db8:42:0::/56,10.244.0.0/16
         serviceSubnet: 2001:db8:42:1::/112,10.96.0.0/16
       # For now, you can add a hosts file entry so that control-plane resolves correctly.
       controlPlaneEndpoint: control-plane
       apiServer:
         certSANs:
          - ::1 # When you set the advertiseAddress to a non-loopback address, you must add the loopback address to the certSANs list.
          - 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
          - 127.0.0.1
          - 2000:192:168:56::11
          - 192.168.56.11
          - control-plane
       ```
    4. start the cluster installation:
       ```shell
       sudo kubeadm config images pull
       sudo kubeadm init --config kubeadm-config.yaml
       ```

       NOTE: The following resources were used to piece all this together:
       [Before you begin], [Creating a cluster with kubeadm].

       NOTE: Typically this is an excellent time to back up the CAs that kubeadm
       generated. You can get away with just the
       `/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.{key,crt}` files because you can then use kubeadm
       to remake all the others. But it is just as easy to just back up the
       entire `/etc/kubernetes/pki` directory.
6. Before we can add any worker nodes machines we need to add a CNI network.
