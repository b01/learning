# Endpoint Slice

An EndpointSlice contains references to a set of network endpoints.
The control plane automatically creates EndpointSlices for any [Service] that
has a selector specified. Which include all the Pods that match the [Service]'s
selector.

It is the mechanism used to let your Service scale to handle large numbers of
backends, and allows the cluster to update its list of healthy backends
efficiently.

Kubernetes updates the EndpointSlices for a Service whenever the set of Pods
in a Service changes.

A Service with no selector does not make the corresponding EndpointSlice objects
automatically.

## Custom EndpointSlices

When you create an EndpointSlice object for a Service, you can use any name for
the EndpointSlice. Each EndpointSlice in a namespace must have a unique name.
You link an EndpointSlice to a Service by setting the
`kubernetes.io/service-name` label on that EndpointSlice.

For an EndpointSlice that you create yourself, or in your own code, you should
also pick a value to use for the label `endpointslice.kubernetes.io/managed-by`.

Note:
The endpoint IPs must not be: loopback (127.0.0.0/8 for IPv4, ::1/128 for IPv6),
or link-local (169.254.0.0/16 and 224.0.0.0/24 for IPv4, fe80::/64 for IPv6).
