# Add Workers

1. Run "kubeadm join..." command on each worker node.
   1. If you opted out of dual-stack, then you simply run the join command
   that was printed out when kubeadm finished installing the cluster on each
   node.
   2. For dual stack clusters, you'll want to specify both IPs for IP families.
   So join will require you to add the IPv6 and IPv4 addresses to the
   kubelet configuration or set the environment variable. If you will need
   to make a `kubelet` config, try setting:
   ```yaml
   ```
2. Run `kubectl get nodes` to verify they are all in the ready state.
