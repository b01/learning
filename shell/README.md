# sh

I try to keep it POSIX. Because I've learned over the years that is best when
trying to share and have it work in just about any environment. That the
different flavors of shells are for individual humans and not so much for
sharing scripts with more than a single individual human/machines, then
expect it to work where those flavors may not be installed.

Here are some great things I've learned about shell scripting that I'd like to
share and hope that you can find useful.

* [Bash Parse Options] - without over complicating the script.
* [Sh Build A Command] from a string then running that command.
* [Powershell] - General notes and quick reminders.
