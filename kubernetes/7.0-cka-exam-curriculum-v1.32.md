# CKA Exam Guide v1.32

The [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Exam Curriculum] outlines what
will be covered on the exam.

This document expands on that document by linking to resources that help you
comprehend each section, and includes examples that you should be able to try;
provided you have access to a Kubernetes cluster.

This document also is organized them same as the CKA exam curriculum, placing
the resources under each section, and in the same order as the curriculum list
them. So if you go from left to right and top-to-bottom, you don't have to
worry that you skipped anything. For those of us that are not so organized.

Note that most, if not all, of the resources linked here are free.
