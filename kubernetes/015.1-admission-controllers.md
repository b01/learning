# Admission Controllers

Intercepts requests to the Kubernetes API server prior to persistence of the
resource, but after the request is authenticated and authorized.

Only apply to requests that create, delete, or modify objects.

Can also block custom verbs

Support validating, mutating, or both.

Are compiled into the kube-apiserver binary, and may only be configured.

You can use these three admission controllers to customize cluster behavior at
admission time:
* MutatingAdmissionWebhook,
* ValidatingAdmissionWebhook,
* and ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.

The admission control process proceeds in two phases. In the first phase,
mutating admission controllers are run. In the second phase, validating
admission controllers are run.

Turn on an admission controller:
```shell
kube-apiserver --enable-admission-plugins=NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger
```

Turn off an admission controller:
```shell
kube-apiserver --disable-admission-plugins=PodNodeSelector,AlwaysDeny
```

See plugins enabled by default:
```shell
kube-apiserver -h | grep enable-admission-plugins
```
