# Add Workers

1. Run "kubeadm join..." command on each worker node.
   1. If you opted out of dual-stack, then you simply run the join command
   that was printed out when kubeadm finished installing the cluster on each
   node.
   2. For dual stack clusters, you'll want to specify both IPs for both IP
   families. So join will require you to add the IPv6 and IPv4 addresses to the
   `kubelet` configuration or set the environment variable. You can see how to
   set it in the shell script [generate-kubelet-extra-args.sh]. However, if you
   need/must make a `kubelet` config, try setting:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta4
   kind: JoinConfiguration
   discovery:
     bootstrapToken:
       apiServerEndpoint: control-plane:6443
       token: "<your-token>"
       caCertHashes:
         - "<your-token-sha>"
       # change auth info above to match the actual token and CA certificate hash for your cluster
   nodeRegistration:
     kubeletExtraArgs:
       - name: "node-ip"
         value: "<IPv6>,<IPv4>"
   ```
   ```shell
   sudo kubeadm join --config kubeadm-join-config.yaml
   ```
2. Run `kubectl get nodes` to verify they are all in the ready state.
