# Control Plane

The control plane's components make global decisions about the cluster.

Control plane components can be run on any machine in the cluster. However,
setup scripts typically start all control plane components on
the same machine. Taints are applied to machines designated to be control-planes
and taints are applied to prevent scheduling Pods on them.

## Components

1. [etcd]
2. [kube-apiserver]
3. [kube-controller-manager]
4. [kube-scheduler]
5. [kubelet]
6. [kube-proxy]
