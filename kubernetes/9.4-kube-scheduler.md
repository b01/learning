# kube-scheduler

The scheduler watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, and selects
a node for them to run on.

Makes the decision which node a Pods should be placed; it does not actually
place them.

It goes through 2 phases to assign a Pod:
1. Filter Nodes - based on Pods' requirements, such as CPU, Memory, or node
   affinity.
2. Rank Nodes - based on some formulae it determines if 1 is a better fit than
   the others. For example, how much CPU would be left given a Pods CPU
   requirements. The one with more CPU left could receive a higher rank.

NOTE: Both Static and DaemonSet Pods are ignored by the `kube-scheduler`.

NOTE: To see if there is a scheduler, review the `kubectl get po -n kube-system`
Pods. Look for a Pod that is named "kube-scheduler-${control-plane-hostname>}".
If there is no scheduler, then Pods are left in a _**pending**_ state.
