# Initialize the Control Plane

## Prerequisites

In order to set up a Dualstack cluster then you'll need:
1. Kubernetes 1.20 or later
2. Nodes with routable IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
3. A network plugin that supports dual-stack.
4. Pass in IPv4 & IPv6 CIDRs to the following components:
   1. `kube-apiserver` set option `--service-cluster-ip-range=<IPv4 CIDR>,<IPv6 CIDR>`
   2. `kube-controller-manager` set options
      ```
      --cluster-cidr=<IPv4 CIDR>,<IPv6 CIDR>
      --service-cluster-ip-range=<IPv4 CIDR>,<IPv6 CIDR>
      --node-cidr-mask-size-ipv4|--node-cidr-mask-size-ipv6
      ```
   3. `kube-proxy` (or replacement) set option `--cluster-cidr=<IPv4 CIDR>,<IPv6 CIDR>`
   4. `kubelet` set option `--node-ip=<IPv4 IP>,<IPv6 IP>`

For more details review [Configure IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack].

## Start Kubelet Service

Time to start the `kubelet` service on the control-plane which, in turn, will
start the control-plane components using their manifest located in
`/etc/kubernetes/manifest`.

1. Make a configuration for the `kubelet`:
   1. Make a `kubelet` config and place it in `/var/lib/kubelet`, there is a
      sample in `samples/config.yaml` in this repository.
      ```shell
      sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/kubelet
      sudo cp /vagrant/config.yaml /var/lib/kubelet
      ```
2. Make a `systemd` unit for the `kubelet.service` which tells the `kubelet`
   service where to find its configuration file and the kubeconfig for
   authenticating with the `kube-apiserver`.
   ```shell
   getIps () {
      iface=${1}
      export IPV4=$(ip -4 addr show scope global dev ${iface} | grep "inet\b" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1)
      export IPV6=$(ip -6 addr show scope global dev ${iface} | grep "inet6\b" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1)
   }
   getIps "enp0s8"
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d
   cp /vagrant/kubelet.service.tmpl
   envsubst < kubelet.service.tmpl | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/kubelet.conf
   ```
3. Copy the `kubelet` key and certificate, and kubeconfig into place.
   ```shell
   sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/kubelet/pki .
   sudo cp ~/certs/control-plane-01.key /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet.key
   sudo cp ~/certs/control-plane-01.crt /var/lib/kubelet/pki/kubelet.crt
   sudo cp ~/certs/control-plane-01.conf /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
   ```
4. Start the cluster components.
   ```shell
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl start kubelet.service
   ```
5. Then check the status of the `kubelet` to make sure it booted successfully.
   ```shell
   sudo systemctl status kubelet.service
   ```
6. Mark the node as a control-plane by adding the following Label and Taint.
   The Taint will prevent Pods from being scheduled on the control-plane unless
   configured to do so; while the label distinguishes it from worker nodes.
   ```shell
   sudo kubectl label nodes control-plane-01 node-restriction.kubernetes.io/control-plane=true \
     --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/super-admin.conf
   sudo kubectl taint nodes control-plane-01 control-plane:NoSchedule \
     --kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/super-admin.conf
   ```
   NOTE: We have not set a default kubeconfig for accessing the cluster at this
   point, which is why we have to specify one. Very useful when you need to try
   out a different config for any reason.

NOTE: If your having issues you can review the `kubelet` logs with
`sudo journalctl -u kubelet.service`.

NOTE: This guide avoids some of the [TLS bootstrapping] process because it is a
cumbersome flow to perform manually.
However, the best part of the TLS bootstrapping process this guide will walk
you through. That's the part where the `kubelet` and the
`kube-controller-manager` are configured so that nodes can auto-renew their
TLS certificates.
