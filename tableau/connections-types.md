# Connection Types

Depending on the data source, you can leverage a live connection, or you can
create an extract and define an extract schedule to keep the data fresh.

Before you can create a workbook and build a view on the web to analyze your
data on the web, you must connect to your data.

Tableau supports connecting to data sources on the web published through
Tableau Desktop, or, connecting to data directly through Tableau Cloud,
Tableau Server, or Tableau Public.

## Open the Connect to Data page

After you sign in to Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud, you can open this page two ways:

* Home > New > Workbook
* Explore > New > Workbook

## Keep Data Fresh

After you publish workbooks and data sources to Tableau Cloud, you can decide
how you want to keep the data current.

See a table of supported data [freshness options by data source].
