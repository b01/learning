# Connected Apps

I'm not seeing any benefit of using a Connected App over a PAT. Especially
since I cannot make a PAT from the API, that endpoint is NOT listed in the
documentation at this time. I'm need to confirm that the COnnected app requires
a PAT, if that is the case, then there is NO benefit with using a Connected App
with Direct Trust.
