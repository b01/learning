# etcd

The key-value database for the `kube-apiserver`. It stores the state of the
cluster. If you have a recent backup of the etcd database, then you can always
restore the cluster to that state.

This data is NOT encrypted. If you want encryption you can encrypt the backup.

This component should come first when bringing up a cluster, and here's why.
If you spin up the `kube-apiserver` first then it has to wait for the etcd
service before it can store any data.
