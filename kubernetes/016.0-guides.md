# Guides

These are guides also serve as answer keys to most of the exercises. Its a good
idea to go through the guides first, then run through the exercises. Although,
you should know that we steer you toward the exercises first. This is to
increase you chances of maintaining the material. I'm not sure what its called,
but when you are presented with a question you cannot answer, then review the
answer afterward, it tends to stick in your memory better.

As such these guides are written with minimal explanation, and just list the
steps to perform the actions needed to achieve a goal. However, we do try to
supply you with links for reading on the subject from the official Kubernetes
documentation.
