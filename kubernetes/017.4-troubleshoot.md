# Troubleshoot

* Error updating the system due to clock issue:
  ```shell
  E: Release file for http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/jammy-security/InRelease is not valid yet (invalid for another 7min 19s). Updates for this repository will not be applied.
  ```
  Fix can be to set the clock: `sudo hwclock --hctosys `
* kubelet will not start:
  1. Check if your machine has swap space on by running `sudo swapon --show`,
     if it is then you either need to configure the kubelet to tolerate it or
     turn it off. It is recommended to turn it off. See your distribution docs
     for how.
