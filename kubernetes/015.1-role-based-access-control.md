# Role Based Access Control

Kubernetes RBAC is required to make use of roles.

## X509 Client Certificates

The `common name` of the subject is used as the username for the request.

Client certificates can also indicate a user's group memberships using the
certificate's `organization` fields.

To grant a user or a group permissions in a cluster, you must use
a `RoleBinding` or `ClusterRoleBinding` to bind them to a `Role`
`ClusterRole`.

To include multiple group memberships for a user, include multiple
`organization` fields in the certificate.

## Make A Role

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: developer
  namespace: development
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] #  leave it blank for core group.
  resources: [ "pods" ] # should also have permission to make deployments and services, which also require endpoint slices, also secrets.

  verbs: [ "list", "get", "create", "update", "delete"]
 ```

## Bind A User to A Role

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: developer-binding
  # to limit a user to a namespace, add that here
subjects:
  - kind: User
    name: jump-box
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: developer
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
