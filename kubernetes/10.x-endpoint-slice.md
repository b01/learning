# Endpoint Slice

An EndpointSlice contains references to a set of network endpoints.
The control plane automatically creates EndpointSlices for any [Service] that
has a selector specified. Which include all the Pods that match the [Service]
selector.

It is the mechanism used to let your Service scale to handle large numbers of
backends, and allows the cluster to update its list of healthy backends
efficiently.
