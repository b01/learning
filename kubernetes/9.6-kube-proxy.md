# kube-proxy

Is a network proxy that runs on each node (as a DaemonSet) in your cluster, and
maintains network rules on nodes. These network rules allow network
communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or out of your
cluster.

Will use the operating system packet filtering layer if there is one, and it's
available. Otherwise, `kube-proxy` forwards the traffic itself.

While the `kubelet` handles node registration with the cluster, it is the
`kube-proxy` that allows it to get into a Ready state, since without the network
rules, nothing will work.

If you use a [network plugin] that implements packet forwarding for Services by
itself (like Antrea), and providing equivalent behavior to `kube-proxy`, then you do not need
to run `kube-proxy` on the nodes in your cluster.


NOTE: `kube-proxy` is considered a legacy add-on, even though it or an
alternative is required in order to have a working cluster. For example
you will not be able join any nodes to the cluster, deploy a DNS, or a CNI addon
until kube-proxy or a similar replacement is running.
